\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{effect_A}{Proportion or RMST of treated patients with and without intervention.}
\item{effect_death}{Proportion or RMST of deaths with and without intervention.}
}
}
\description{
Calculate the effect of an intervention modifying the treatment process intensity.
}
\details{
This function simulates event history data from the Treatment scenario (see function simTreatment)
under intervention and without intervention. We consider the intervention where
the \eqn{\eta} parameter of the treatment process is multiplied by a factor \code{alpha}.
It computes the proportion or RMST of death and treatment by time \eqn{\tau}
comparing intervened and non-intervened data.
