\item{eta}{Vector of length 4 of shape parameters for the Weibull intensity with parameterization
\deqn{\eta \nu t^{\nu - 1}}. Default is set to 0.1 for all events.}

\item{nu}{Vector of scale parameters for the Weibull hazard. Default is set to 0.1 for all events.}

\item{followup}{A maximal censoring time. By default set to infinity.}

\item{cens}{Specifies whether you are at risk of being censored}

\item{op}{Specifies whether you are at risk of being operated}
}
\value{
Data frame containing the simulated data. There is a column for ID, time of event (Time),
event type (Delta), baseline covariate (L0), additional covariate (L) and  Treatment Process (A).
}
\description{
Function to simulate data from a event history setting with a time dependent confounder.
}
\details{
4 different types of events are simulated, chosen to represent Censoring (0),Death (1),
Operation(2) and Change in Covariate Process(3). Death and Censoring are terminal events
and Operation and Change in Covariate Process can occur once.

The intensities of the various events are controlled by the parameters beta parameters and
\eqn{\nu} and \eqn{\eta} parameters. For example \code{beta_L_A} determines the effect of L = 1
on the event A.
