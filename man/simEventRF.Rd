\title{Simulate Event History Data Based on fitted RF}
\usage{
simEventRF(
  N,
  RF_fit,
  event_names = NULL,
  L0_old,
  A0_old,
  n_event_max = c(1, 1),
  term_events = 1,
  intervention1 = NULL,
  intervention2 = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. The number of individuals to simulate.}

\item{RF_fit}{A rfsrc object. The object contains estimates of the cumulative hazard of each of the processes.}

\item{event_names}{A character vector. Containing the names of the various processes. The argument is optional.}

\item{L0_old}{A vector of previously observed baseline covariate values for L0,
used for resampling baseline covariates.}

\item{A0_old}{A vector of previously observed baseline covariate values for A0,
used for resampling baseline covariates.}

\item{n_event_max}{Integer vector. Maximum number of times each event type can occur
per individual.}

\item{term_events}{Integer or integer vector. Indices of event types that are terminal,
i.e., events that stop further simulation for an individual.}

\item{intervention1}{Optional function. Not implemented.}

\item{intervention2}{Optional function. Not implemented.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with one row per event per individual containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{ID} — Individual identifier.
\item \code{Time} — Event time.
\item \code{Delta} — Event type indicator.
\item Baseline covariates \code{L0}, \code{A0}.
\item Columns for each event type indicating cumulative event counts.
}
}
\description{
Simulates recurrent and terminal event data for a cohort of individuals based
on a random forest fitted using the \code{randomForestSRC} package. Simulation proceeds
by iteratively sampling event times until a terminal event occurs.
}
\details{
The function simulates individual event histories by:
\enumerate{
\item Sampling initial baseline covariates (\code{L0}, \code{A0}) by resampling observed values.
\item Extracting cumulative hazard functions from the RF model.
\item Iteratively sampling event times.
\item Updating covariate histories and event counts.
\item Stopping simulation per individual after a terminal event or maximum events reached.
