\title{Simulate Survival and Competing Risk Data Based on a fitted RF}
\usage{
simEventRF(
  N,
  RF_fit,
  event_names = NULL,
  list_old_vars,
  n_event_max = c(1, 1),
  term_events = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. The number of individuals to simulate.}

\item{RF_fit}{A rfsrc object. The object contains estimates of the cumulative hazard of each of the processes.}

\item{event_names}{A character vector. Containing the names of the various processes. The argument is optional.}

\item{list_old_vars}{A named list containing the old covariates}

\item{n_event_max}{Integer vector. Maximum number of times each event type can occur
per individual.}

\item{term_events}{Integer or integer vector. Indices of event types that are terminal,
i.e., events that stop further simulation for an individual.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with one row per event per individual containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{ID} — Individual identifier.
\item \code{Time} — Event time.
\item \code{Delta} — Event type indicator.
\item Baseline covariates \code{L0}, \code{A0}.
\item Columns for each event type indicating cumulative event counts.
}
}
\description{
Simulates survival or competing risk data for a cohort of individuals based
on a random forest fitted using the \code{randomForestSRC} package. Simulation proceeds
by iteratively sampling event times until a terminal event occurs.
}
\details{
The function simulates individual event histories by:
\enumerate{
\item Sampling initial baseline covariates (\code{L0}, \code{A0}) by resampling observed values.
\item Extracting cumulative hazard functions from the RF model.
\item Iteratively sampling event times.
\item Updating covariate histories and event counts.
\item Stopping simulation per individual after a terminal event or maximum events reached.
}
}
\examples{
# The observed data
beta = matrix(c(0.5,-1,-0.5,0.5,0,0.5), ncol = 3, nrow = 2)
data <- simCRdata(N = 100, beta = beta)
# Random forest model
RF_fit <- randomForestSRC::rfsrc(Surv(Time, Delta) ~ L0 + A0, data = data)
# New data
list_old_vars <- list(L0 = data$L0, A0 = data$A0)
new_data <- simEventRF(100, RF_fit, list_old_vars = list_old_vars, term_events = c(1,2))
