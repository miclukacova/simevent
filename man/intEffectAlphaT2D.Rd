cumulative hazard.}

\value{
A list of proportions of dead and T2D patients by time \eqn{\tau}
in the A0 = a0 group in respectively intervened data and non intervened data.
}
\description{
Function to calculate the effect of an intervention where the eta parameter of
the T2D process is multiplied by the factor alpha. We consider the outcome
variable death and T2D at time \eqn{\tau} - that is the output of the function is
the proportion of dead and T2D diagnosed patients by time \eqn{\tau} in A0 = a0
group in respectively intervened data and non intervened data.
