\usage{
alphaSim(
  N = 10000,
  eta = rep(0.1, 4),
  nu = rep(1.1, 4),
  alpha = 0.5,
  tau = 5,
  a0 = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. Number of individuals to simulate. Default is 10,000.}

\item{eta}{Numeric vector. Shape parameters for Weibull hazards. Length of the vector should
match number of events. For the Disease and Drop In setting this is 4. For the Treatment setting,
this is 3. (default \code{rep(0.1, 4)}).}

\item{nu}{Numeric vector. Scale parameters for Weibull hazards. Length of the vector should
match number of events. For the Disease and Drop In setting this is 4.  For the Treatment setting,
this is 3. (default \code{rep(1.1, 4)}).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric scalar. Multiplicative factor applied to the disease process shape parameter \eqn{\eta}.}

\item{tau}{Numeric scalar. Time horizon at which proportions are computed.}

\item{a0}{Binary (0/1). Specifies the group for comparison in setting Drop In and Disease.}

\item{years_lost}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, computes years lost instead of proportions.}

\item{setting}{Character string. Must be either "Disease", "Drop In" or "Treatment". Depending on the simulation setting.}

\item{return_data}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} the simulated data is returned.}

\item{cens}{Binary scalar. Indicates whether individuals are at risk of censoring (default \code{0}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to respectively simDisease, simTreatment and simDropIn.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{\code{effect_L}}{Proportion (or years lost) of individuals diagnosed with disease by time \eqn{\tau}, under intervention.}
\item{\code{effect_death}}{Proportion (or years lost) of individuals who died by time \eqn{\tau} under intervention.}
}
Or the simulated data.
}
\description{
This function simulates event history data from either the Disease, Treatment or Drop In setting.
See simDisease, simTreatment and simDropIn. The shape parameter \eqn{\eta} of respectively the disease process,
the Drop In process and the Treatment process is multiplied by \code{alpha}. The function either
\itemize{
\item returns the proportion of individuals who experience death and the proportion of individuals who experience disease/drop in/treatment
by a specified time \eqn{\tau} (in group \code{A0 = a0} for drop in and disease).
\item returns number of years lost before \eqn{\tau} of death and disease/drop in/treatment
\item returns simulated data.
One can specify all the same parameters as in the functions \code{simDisease}, \code{simTreatment} and \code{simDropIn}.
