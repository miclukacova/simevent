  N,

\arguments{
\item{N}{A double for the number of simulated individuals}

\item{beta}{A matrix of doubles for the effects on the intensities. The columns
represent the events. In the default case 4 events. The rows represent covariates
and processes: the first two rows determine the effects of the baseline covariate
\eqn{L0} and \eqn{A0} on the processes. The next rows determine the effects of the
processes, followed by additional baseline covariates. The \eqn{\beta} matrix is
by default set to 0.}

\item{eta}{Vector of shape parameters for the Weibull intensity with parameterization
\deqn{\eta \nu t^{\nu - 1}} Default is set to 0.1 for all events.}

\item{nu}{Vector of scale parameters for the Weibull intensity. Default is set
to 1.1 for all events.}

\item{at_risk}{At risk function. Default is set to setting where all events
can always occur. The \code{at_risk} function determines whether an individual
is at risk for a specific event. The function takes as input i (the index belonging
to a particular individual), and the matrix event_counts, which keeps track of
the occurrence of the different event. The matrix is N times number of events
An entrance \eqn{x_{ij}} indicates how many times individual i has experienced
event j. The function returns a vector of 0's  and 1's corresponding to whether
individual i is at risk for the particular events.}

\item{term_deltas}{Terminal events. Default is set so that event 1 and 2 are terminal events.}

\item{max_cens}{A maximum censoring time. By default set to infinity. If the event
time is larger than this maximimal censoring time the event becomes event 0 with
probability 1.}

\item{add_cov}{List of random generator functions for the distributions of
additional baseline covariates. The functions should take the number of observations
as input. By default set to NULL.}
}
\value{
data.table containing the simulated data. There is a column for ID, time
of event (Time), event (Delta), baseline covariate (L0), Baseline Treatment (A0),
the count of the various events: N1, N2, .... In case of additional covariates
these are included in the data as well, named L1, L2, ....
}
\description{
\code{simEventData2} is a function to simulate event data, e.g. observational healthcare
data. The number of events simulated corresponds to the length of the \eqn{\eta}
and \eqn{\nu} vector, as well as the number of columns in the \eqn{\beta} matrix. By
default 4 different types of events are simulated. The first two being terminal
processes. The simulations build upon a counting process framework, where the events
have intensities given by
\deqn{\lambda^x(t) = \lambda_0^x \exp(\beta^T_x L}
L here represents covariates and event counts. The baseline intensity \eqn{\lambda_0^x}
is given by
\deqn{\lambda_0^x(t)=\eta^x \nu^x t^{\nu^x - 1}}
The intensities of the various events depend upon previous events and
baseline covariates through the \eqn{\beta} matrix. The pre specified \eqn{\nu}
and \eqn{\eta} parameters also influence the intensities of the various events
through the baseline intensity.
