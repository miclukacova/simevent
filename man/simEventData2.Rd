  N,

\arguments{
\item{N}{A double for the number of simulated individuals}

\item{beta}{A matrix of doubles for the effects of covariates and events on the
intensities. The columns represent the events. In the default case 4 events.
The rows represent covariates  and processes: the first two rows determine the
effects of the baseline covariate \eqn{L0} and \eqn{A0} on the processes. The
next rows determine the effects of the processes, followed by additional baseline
covariates. The \eqn{\beta} matrix is by default set to 0.}

\item{eta}{Vector of shape parameters for the baseline intensity. Default is set
to 0.1 for all events.}

\item{nu}{Vector of scale parameters for the baseline intensity. Default is set
to 1.1 for all events.}

\item{at_risk}{At risk function. The \code{at_risk} function determines whether
an individual is at risk for a specific event. The function takes as input a vector
\code{events} of event counts. The function returns a vector of 0's and 1's indicating
which events the subject is at risk for. Default is set to a setting where you
are always at risk for all events.}

\item{term_deltas}{Terminal events. Default is set so that event 0 and 1 are
terminal events.}

\item{max_cens}{A maximum censoring time. By default set to infinity. If the event
time is larger than this maximimal censoring time the event becomes event 0 with
probability 1.}

\item{add_cov}{List of random generator functions for the distributions of
additional baseline covariates. The functions should take the number of observations
as input. By default set to NULL.}
}
\value{
data.table containing the simulated data. There is a column for ID, time
of event (Time), event (Delta), baseline covariate (L0), Baseline Treatment (A0),
the count of the various events: N1, N2, .... In case of additional covariates
these are included in the data as well, named L1, L2, ....
}
\description{
\code{simEventData2} is a function to simulate continuous time to event data, e.g. observational
healthcare data. The number of events simulated corresponds to the length of the \eqn{\eta}
and \eqn{\nu} vector, as well as the number of columns in the \eqn{\beta} matrix. By
default 4 different types of events are simulated. The first two being terminal
processes. The simulations build upon a counting process framework, where the events
have intensities given by
\deqn{\lambda^x(t) = \lambda_0^x \exp(\beta^T_x L)}
L here represents covariates and event counts. The baseline intensity \eqn{\lambda_0^x}
is given by
\deqn{\lambda_0^x(t)=\eta^x \nu^x t^{\nu^x - 1}}
The intensities of the various events depend upon previous events and
baseline covariates through the \eqn{\beta} matrix. The pre specified \eqn{\nu}
and \eqn{\eta} parameters also influence the intensities of the various events
through the baseline intensity.
