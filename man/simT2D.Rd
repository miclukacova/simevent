\arguments{
\item{N}{A double of the number of individuals}

\item{eta}{Vector of length 4 of shape parameters for the Weibull intensity with parameterization
\deqn{\eta \nu t^{\nu - 1}}. Default is set to 0.1 for all events.}

\item{nu}{Vector of scale parameters for the Weibull hazard. Default is set to 1.1 for all events.}

\item{cens}{Specifies whether you are at risk of being censored}

\item{beta_L0_D}{Specifies how baseline covariate affects risk of Death. Is by default set to 1.}

\item{beta_L0_L}{Specifies how change in the covariate process affects risk of death. Is by default set to 1.}

\item{beta_L_D}{Specifies how change in the covariate process affects risk of death. Is by default set to 1.}

\item{beta_A0_D}{Specifies how baseline treatment affects risk of death. Is by default set to 0.}

\item{beta_A0_L}{Specifies how baseline treatment affects risk of T2D. Is by default set to 0.}

\item{followup}{A maximal censoring time. By default set to infinity.}
}
\value{
Data frame containing the simulated data. There is a column for ID, time of event (Time),
event type (Delta), baseline covariate (L0) and additional covariate (L).

\description{
Function to simulate data from a T2D diabetes setting. 3 different types of
events are simulated. They can be interpreted as Censoring(0), Death (1) and
Change in Covariate Process (3). Death and Censoring are terminal events and Change in
Covariate Process can occur once. The intensities of the various events depend
upon previous events and the pre specified \eqn{\nu} and \eqn{\eta} parameters.
The dependence on previous events is controlled by parameters chosen so that a
large baseline covariate (L0) increases the probability of covariate change (L = 1).
Initial treatment (A0 = 1) reduces the risk of a change in the covariate process
(L= 1) and the risk of death. A large baseline covariate (L0) increase the risk of death.
Censoring does not depend on anything. The risk of death depends on change in
the covariate process (L = 1) through beta_L_D.
