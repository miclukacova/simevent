  N,

  time_var_eff = NULL,
  t_prime = Inf,
  eta = NULL,
  nu = NULL,

\value{
data.table containing the simulated data. There is a column for ID, time
of event (Time), event (Delta), baseline covariate (L0), Baseline Treatment (A0),
the count of the various events: N1, N2, .... In case of additional covariates
these are included in the data as well, named L1, L2, ....
}
\description{
\code{simEventDataTry} is a work in progress function. We are trying to modify simEventData
so that we can simulate data with time varying effects. For now it only works for
a single event occurrence.
}
\examples{
eta <- rep(0.1, 2)
term_deltas <- c(0,1)
simEventDataTry(N = 100, t_prime = 1, eta = eta, term_deltas = term_deltas)

}
