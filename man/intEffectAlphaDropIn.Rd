\details{
This function simulates event history data from the Drop In scenario. This is a
scenario with the events Censoring (C), Death (D), Drop In Initiation (Z),
Change in Covariate Process (L) and optionally Treatment (A). It simulates
under the intervnetion where \eqn{\eta} parameter of the Drop In process is multiplied
by a factor \code{alpha}. It evaluates the proportion of death and Drop In events
by time \eqn{\tau} within the subgroup defined by \code{A0 = a0}.
