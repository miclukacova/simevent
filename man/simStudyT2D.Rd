\description{
Function that performs a simulation study of the Kaplan-Meier estimator on data
from a T2D diabetes setting. Data is simulated by use of the function simT2D.
Right censoring is incorporated, and the L1 variable is omitted. The estimand is
\deqn{S(\tau | A_0 = 1) = P(T \geq \tau | A_0 = 1) , \quad S(\tau | A_0 = 0) = P(T \geq \tau | A_0 = 0)}
For some \eqn{\tau \in \mathbb{R}}. \eqn{T} is here the survival time \emph{post} T2D diagnose.
The survival function will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
Post T2D diagnose, the setting is simpler, as there are no competing events, only death and censoring.
The Kaplan-Meier estimator will then be an unbiased estimator of the survival probability.
The function generates B data sets with N individuals. For each data set we find the
Kaplan-Meier estimate of \eqn{P(T \geq \tau | A_0 = a_0)}, the SE, and the upper and
