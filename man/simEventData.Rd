  beta = NULL,
  eta = rep(0.1, 4),

\arguments{
\item{N}{A double for the number of simulated individuals}

\item{beta}{A matrix of doubles for the effects on the intensities. The columns
represent the events. The rows represent covariates and processes. By default
the rows represent: the baseline covariate \eqn{L0} (which can be interpreted
as age of participant), baseline treatment \eqn{A0}, the indicator for change
in the covariate process  \eqn{L}, and the indicator  for operation \eqn{A}.
If additional covariates are specified, each of these corresponds to an additional
row in the beta matrix. The \eqn{\beta} matrix is by default set to 0.}

\item{eta}{Vector of shape parameters for the baseline Weibull intensity with
parameterization
\deqn{\eta \nu t^{\nu - 1}}
Default is set to 0.1 for all events.}

\item{nu}{Vector of scale parameters for the Weibull intensity. Default is set
to 1.1 for all events.}

\item{at_risk}{At risk function. Default is set to the operation setting. That is
a setting where operation and covariate change can occur once, and censoring and
death are terminal events that the individual is always at risk for. The \code{at_risk}
function is an indicator of whether an individual is at risk for a specific event.
The function takes as input i (the index belonging to a particular individual),
L (indicator for a change in covariate) and A (indicator for change in treatment process).
The function returns a vector of 0's  and 1's corresponding to whether individual
i is at risk for a particular event.}

\item{term_deltas}{Terminal events. Default is set so that event 1 and 2 are terminal events.}

\item{max_cens}{A maximum censoring time. By default set to infinity.}

\item{add_cov}{List of random generator functions for the distributions of
additional baseline covariates. The functions should take the number of observations
as input. By default set to NULL.}
}
\value{
data.table containing the simulated data. There is a column for ID, time
of event (Time), event type (Delta), baseline covariate (L0), indicator for change
in covariate process (L), Baseline Treatment (A0), indicator for Operation (A).
In case of additional covariates these are included in the data as well,
named L1, L2, ....

\description{
\code{simEventData} is a function to simulate observational healthcare
data. The number of events simulated corresponds to the length of the \eqn{\eta}
and \eqn{\nu} vector, and the number of columns in the \eqn{\beta} matrix. By
default 4 different types of events are simulated, which can be interpreted as
Censoring (0), Death (1), Operation(2) and Change in Covariate Process(3).
Event 0 and Event 1 are terminal events by default and Event 2 and Event 3
Process can occur once.  The simulations build upon a counting processes framework,
where the events have intensities given by
\deqn{\lambda^x(t) = \lambda_0^x \exp(\beta^T_x L}
L here represents covariates and event counts. The baseline intensity \eqn{\lambda_0^x}
is given by
\deqn{\lambda_0^x(t)=\eta^x \nu^x t^{\nu^x - 1}}
The intensities of the various events depend upon previous events and
baseline covariates through the \eqn{\beta} matrix. The pre specified \eqn{\nu}
and \eqn{\eta} parameters also influence the intensities of the various events
through the baseline intensity.

\details{
Different settings can be specified: Survival setting, competing risk setting
and operation setting. The different settings can be specified by the at_risk function.
